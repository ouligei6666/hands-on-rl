```

```
That error comes from a Gym API change: in newer Gym, `envs.registry` is a dict, not an object with `.all()`. I updated the registry access to handle both cases.

Applied fix in __init__.py.

Try re-running Cell 1. If you still see a different error, paste it and I will help.

Made changes.

That error is another Gym API rename: `EnvSpec._kwargs` is now `EnvSpec.kwargs`. I patched ma-gym to support both.

Change is in __init__.py.

Please re-run Cell 1. If a new error appears, paste it and I will fix the next one.
